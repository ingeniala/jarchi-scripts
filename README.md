## Code of conduct

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can or can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

* __Be friendly and patient.__
* __Be welcoming.__ We welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* __Be considerate.__ Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. 
* __Be respectful.__ Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. 
* __Be careful__ in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. 
* __When we disagree, try to understand why.__ Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
